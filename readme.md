# Here is an introduction to the code

1. Run the main.py function to train the model.
2. The test_some_examples.ipynb file shows the test results of some pictures and completes the visualization.
3. The test__the_model.ipynb file is used to test the test set and output IoU.
4. To run the code, you need to add a data set, and be careful to modify the path of the data set in the code.
5. The test_portraitnet.ipynb file is used to train the model on the server.
6. The files in the data folder are the data enhancement parts copied from the source code.
